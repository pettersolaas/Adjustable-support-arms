Originally made to support the case feeder drop tube on my reloading press where I needed a pipe to slide up and down as the press was operated. But this can be used for lots of other stuff too, at least without the tube adapter. The two arms are adjustable in length. It works best in the 175-220mm range, but it can be pushed out to ca 265mm. The flat face of the support arm is 23x60mm.

The support arm has a flat base and holes intended for wood screws. If you want to support something with a flat surface, you print 2 x "Support arm V2.stl".

If you want to attach a tube/pipe/hose at one end, you need to replace one of the support arms with a "Support arm V2 to tube adapter" and the tube adapter itself. The tube adapter is intended to be attached to the arm with two small wooden screws. The inner diameter of the tube adapter is 17,4mm.

Recommended hardware:
2 x M6x25mm (or longer) bolts
2 x M6 locking nuts
4 x washers

This is version two. The first version has slightly thinner arms and an open-faced tube adapter. It can be found here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6201332
