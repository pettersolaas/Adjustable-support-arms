Originally made to support the case feeder drop tube on my reloading press, but it can be used for lots of other stuff too. Adjustable in length. It works best in the 175-220mm range, but it can be pushed out to ca 265mm. The flat face of the support arm is 23x60mm.

The support arm has a flat base and holes for both wood screws and dowel pins. If you want to attach a tube/pipe/hose at one end, you can print the tube adapter and two dowel pins. Snap the tube adapter in place on the support arm with the dowel pins, and secure the tube/pipe/hose with two zip ties. The diameter of the cutout on the tube adapter face is 20,5mm.

Recommended hardware:
2 x M6x25mm (or longer) bolts
2 x M6 locking nuts
4 x washers

This is version one. I also made a second version with slightly thicker arms and a closed tube adapter. It can be found here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6201380
